## Usage Examples

### #1 `pull_request` event requiring 1 approval each from 2 teams

The bare minimum configuration requires a GitHub access token with 'read:org' scope and the team name whose approval is required. The default number of approvals is set to 1 on the PR which triggered the workflow and can be called multiple times for different teams.

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

steps:
  - name: Require DEV team approval
    uses: op5dev/require-team-approval@v1
    with:
      team: dev-team
      token: ${{ secrets.CI_PAT }}

  - name: Require QA team approval
    uses: op5dev/require-team-approval@v1
    with:
      team: qa-team
      token: ${{ secrets.CI_PAT }}
```

</br>

### #2 `pull_request_review` event requiring 2 approvals with outputs

This configuration demonstrates a more targeted approach by checking for approvals only when an `approved` review is submitted. The outputs provide detailed information about the approvals, both by the team and the PR in general, for use in subsequent steps as counts or named lists.

```yaml
on:
  pull_request_review:
    types: [submitted]

jobs:
  check:
    if: github.event.review.state == 'approved'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Require QA team approval x2
        id: approval
        uses: op5dev/require-team-approval@v1
        with:
          approvals: 2
          team: qa-team
          token: ${{ secrets.CI_PAT }}

      - run: |
          echo "Got ${{ steps.approval.outputs.team-approvals-count }} / 2 approvals from QA."
          echo "Got ${{ steps.approval.outputs.pr-approvals-count }} approvals in total."
```
